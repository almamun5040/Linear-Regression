# Linear-Regression

In this beginner-oriented guide - we'll be performing linear regression in Python, utilizing the Scikit-Learn library. We'll go through an end-to-end machine learning pipeline. We'll first load the data we'll be learning from and visualizing it, at the same time performing Exploratory Data Analysis. Then, we'll pre-process the data and build models to fit it (like a glove). This model is then evaluated, and if favorable, used to predict new values based on new input.
